[@evanpro](https://twitter.com/evanpro) Here are the results of my first dive into pump.io this weekend for [IWC:H](http://indiewebcamp.com/2013/hollywood): 

- [Documentation Ideas](https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/pull/870)
- [First pass at adding Microformats 2](https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/pull/871)

Next step is getting pump.io fully configured on my server.  Really digging pump so far!
